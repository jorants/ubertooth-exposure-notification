# Ubertooth Exposure Notification
Example c program to send exposure notifications from the GAEN framework using an ubertooth.

Due to the size of exposure notifications this requires patched firmware, see https://github.com/jorants/ubertooth

Since the ubertooth is a class 1 device, the packets can reach rather far.
